        web app.

      <p>
        I believe that keeping track of the validity periods for important
        documents can be a hassle. That's why I've created a simple, easy-to-use
        tool that helps you manage these expiration dates.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know how important it is to
        <strong>keep track of expiration dates</strong> for things like
        passports, driver's licenses, and insurance policies, and I want to
        make it as easy as possible for users to stay organized. With this app,
        you can easily set up notifications for when a document is set to
        expire. These notifications can be
        <strong>synced with your calendar app</strong>, so you never miss an
        important deadline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for considering my project, and I hope you will give it a try

      <p>
        <strong>P.S.</strong> I believe in the power of open-source software.
        That's why I've made my project available on GitHub for anyone to
        contribute to. If you have ideas for new features or ways to improve our
        app, I encourage you to share them on our
